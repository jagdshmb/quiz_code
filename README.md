A Quiz system is developed from the scratch using C++ language.
In this Questions, options and  answers are stored in a file.
Questions are randomly chooen from the file.
At the end result and rank of the participants are stored in the file.
And for a quiz host we have provided the oppertunity to edit the rank list in GUI.
We have used OOPS and File handling concepts here to develop this project.
